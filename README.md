# 🎯 Hangman Game

A Hangman game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word based on a given hint. The game ends when the player either guesses all letters correctly or makes too many wrong guesses (with each wrong guess the picture of the hangman updates).
